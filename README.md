# Hospital Emergency Room (ER) Triage System
##  *Module:** Programming Data Structures and Algorithms

### Project Description
This is a console-based application to manage a Hospital Emergency Room queue using the **Heap (Priority Queue)** data structure.

### Key Features
* **Priority Handling:** Patients are sorted based on medical severity (Critical > High > Medium > Low).
* **Efficiency:** Uses a Min-Heap algorithm for O(1) access to critical patients.
* **Fairness:** If severity is equal, the First-Come-First-Serve (FCFS) rule applies.

### How to Run
1. Download `EmergencyRoomSystem.java`.
2. Compile: `javac EmergencyRoomSystem.java`
3. Run: `java EmergencyRoomSystem`
